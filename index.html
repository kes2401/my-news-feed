<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>The Guardian encourages confidential tips to investigate stories in the public interest, emphasizing protection of sources' identities.  They prioritize newsworthy leads with concrete details—names, dates, locations, and evidence—and will not pursue vague or speculative information.  Secure communication methods are outlined, including SecureDrop (for anonymous document sharing), Signal (recommended encrypted messaging app), and WhatsApp (less secure but widely used).  Email is suggested for less sensitive information, but users should create a new account and use precautions to protect their privacy.  Phone calls are less secure but can initiate contact.  Postal mail is also an option, but users should consider the risks of loss and tracing.  The article stresses the importance of clear, concise tips and warns against using standard communication methods for sensitive information.  Finally, it clarifies that this guide is for news tips, not general inquiries or complaints.</p>
